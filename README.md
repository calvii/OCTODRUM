#  OctoDrum üéØ

### Project Description
OctoDrum turns your number pad into an 8-zone virtual drum kit. Each key triggers a unique drum sound, stopping the previous one for realistic play. Built with Python and Pygame, it‚Äôs a fun way to explore music, coding, and real-time audio interaction.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Making sick beats on your laptop is hard‚Ä¶ especially when you don‚Äôt own a drum kit, have no rhythm, and your trackpad refuses to cooperate. Clearly, the world needed a way to turn a boring numeric keypad into a rockstar‚Äôs drum machine ‚Äî so here we are. ü•Åüíª

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We hacked together a program that turns your humble numeric keypad into an 8-zone virtual drum kit. Press a key, hear a beat ‚Äî no drumsticks, no music theory, no neighbours calling the cops. Just instant groove at your fingertips. ü•Å‚ú®

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
# 1. Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/octodrum.git    

# 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  

# 3. Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

# 4. Run the program  
python test.py  


# Run
python test.py

### Project Documentation
For Software:The OctoDrum software listens for number pad key presses (mapped to 8 zones of a virtual drum).  
When a specific key is pressed, the corresponding drum sound plays instantly, while stopping any previously playing sound to avoid overlap.  
The code is written in Python using `pygame` for audio playback and `keyboard` for key detection.  
The logic maps each number key to a unique drum sound file stored locally.
